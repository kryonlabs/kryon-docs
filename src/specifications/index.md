## Frequently Asked Questions

### Which specification should I read first?
Start with the **Overview Specification** unless you're already familiar with Kryon concepts. It provides the foundation needed to understand the more technical documents.

### Do I need to read all three specifications?
No. Choose based on your needs:
- **Learning Kryon**: Overview Specification
- **Building tools**: Implementation Specification  
- **Solving specific problems**: Reference Specification

### How do these relate to the existing documentation?
These specifications are comprehensive versions of the existing reference documentation. They include everything from the existing docs plus implementation details, algorithms, and complete examples.

### Are these specifications normative?
Yes. These specifications define the official behavior of Kryon compilers, runtimes, and file formats. Implementations should conform to these specifications for compatibility.

### How often are specifications updated?
- **Major updates**: With each Kryon version release
- **Minor updates**: For clarifications and corrections
- **Breaking changes**: Only with major version releases

### Can I implement Kryon based solely on these specifications?
Yes. The Implementation and Reference specifications contain all information needed to build a complete, compatible Kryon implementation from scratch.
